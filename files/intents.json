However, LLC owners have the same advantage of limited personal liability for company debts as with a Corporation. If the LLC is sued, only business assets (not members' personal assets) are at risk. Primary advantages of the LLC: limited personal liability for the LLC's debts; no taxation at the corporate level. The LLC passes income and losses to the LLC members who report their share of the LLC's profits and losses on their personal tax returns,LLCs are not typically limited in the number of members the entity can have; LLCs are less formal and easier to manage and require less paperwork and administrative duties than a Corporation."
